### About this Project

Senior year of highschool I had finally figured out most of the nuances of pixi.js by making a few simple platformer prototypes. I wanted to make a full game and get experience with packaging and publishing on the popular platform of the time, Kongregate. And thus, Fractured Snake was created. For the most part this was a generic game of snake, but there was one innovation I was proud of.

While the game offered a “classic” mode that was a standard snake game. I was fairly proud of the colors mode (pictured in the thumbnail for this post). In the colors mode the A, S, and D keys would change the color of the head of the snake and every segment that came next. The snake would only collide with the same color, and this allowed the player to overlap themselves which opens another level of possibilities and complex moves.

### Technical Details

Unfortunately, the source files for this project seem to have been lost. This was one of the last projects before I learned Git. That said, I clearly remember spending an hour creating the entire 5x8 font as a map of 2d binary arrays. One can see the effect in all the text for this project which used a custom renderer.
